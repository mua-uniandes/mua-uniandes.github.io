# Convex Hull Problems

A ***convex hull*** is the smallest convex polygon that contains all points of a given
point set. Here convexity means that a line segment between any two vertices of the
polygon is completely inside the polygon.

**NOTE:** There are many efficient algorithms for constructing convex hulls. Perhaps the
simplest among them is Andrewâ€™s algorithm

**Andrew's algorithm:**
The algorithm first determines the leftmost and rightmost points in the set, and then
constructs the convex hull in two parts: first the upper hull and then the lower hull.
Both parts are similar, so we can focus on constructing the upper hull.
First, we sort the points primarily according to x coordinates and secondarily
according to y coordinates. After this, we go through the points and add each point
to the hull. Always after adding a point to the hull, we make sure that the last line
segment in the hull does not turn left. As long as it turns left, we repeatedly remove
the second last point from the hull.
