# Graphs

## Overview

Graphs are one of the most important mathematical concepts in Computer Science. They allow the study of interrelations between units that interact with others. As for their applications, they are found in Artficial Intelligence, Data Mining, Game Development, GeoInformatics, and a host of other disciplines.

## Concepts

A ***Graph*** consists of ***nodes*** (also known as *vertices*) that are connected through ***edges***. As for the purpose of these notes, the variable **V** will denote the number of nodes in a graph, and the variable **E** will denote the number of edges.

A ***Path*** leads from a node to another node through the edges of the graph. The ***length*** of a path is the number of edges in it.

A ***cycle*** is a path where the first and last node is the same.  A graph is ***connected*** if there is a path between any two nodes. The connected parts of a graph are called its ***components***. A ***tree*** is a connected graph that does not contain cycles. In a ***directed graph***, the edges can be traversed in one direction only. 

In a ***weighted graph***, each edge is assigned a *weight*. The weights are often interpreted as edge lengths, and the length of a path is the sum of its edge weights. Two nodes are ***neighbors*** or ***adjacent*** if there is an edge between them. The ***degree*** of a node is the number of its neighbors. The sum of degrees in a graph is always **2E**, because each edge increases the degree of exactly two nodes by one. For this reason, the sum of degrees is always even.
 A graph is ***regular*** if the degree of every node is a constant d. A graph is ***complete*** if the degree of every node is n âˆ’1, i.e., the graph contains all possible edges between the nodes.
 
In a **directed graph**, the ***indegree*** of a node is the number of edges that end at the node, and the ***outdegree of a node*** is the number of edges that start at the node.

A graph is **bipartite** if it is possible to color its nodes using two colors in such a way that no adjacent nodes have the same color. It turns out that a graph is bipartite exactly when it does not have a cycle with an odd number of edges.
