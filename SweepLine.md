# Sweep Line algorithms

Many geometric problems can be solved using sweep line algorithms. The idea in
such algorithms is to represent an instance of the problem as a set of events that
correspond to points in the plane. Then, the events are processed in increasing order
according to their x or y coordinates. Moreover, a **sweep line algorithm** also known as plane sweep algorithm is an algorithmic paradigm that uses a conceptual sweep line or sweep surface to solve various problems in Euclidean space. It is one of the key techniques in ***computational geometry***.
